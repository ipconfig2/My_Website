      <h2>Project Overview and Motivation</h2>
      <p>As part of my SQL and database management coursework, I developed a relational database system to manage essential data for a medical practice. This project provides a complete, structured approach to organizing physician, patient, visit, and payment information, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency. The purpose of this database is to facilitate daily operations in a healthcare setting, such as tracking patient visits, recording financial transactions, and maintaining physician information.</p>
      <p>By designing this SQL-based system, I aimed to create a scalable solution that can handle the various needs of a medical practice. The database includes features like automated balance updates, salary tracking for physicians, and reports based on patient diagnoses. This project demonstrates how SQL and relational database design can streamline complex data management tasks, making it ideal for environments where data accuracy and accessibility are crucial.</p>
