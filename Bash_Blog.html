          <h2>Introduction:</h2>
          <p>Nowadays IT business environments are fast-paced to help processes of repetitive tasks go faster lots of businesses are starting to utilize scripts to automate these tasks. A common task for businesses is uploading files to Azure Storage solutions. Uploading files manually to Azure Storage can be time-consuming and error-prone. The need for an automated solution led to me developing a Bash script that leverages the power of the Azure CLI. In the following blog post, I will explain my process for making such a script to automate this task as well as how the script works.</p>

      <section id="script">
          <h2>The Script:</h2>
          <h3>upload_script.sh</h3>
          <p>The <code>upload_script.sh</code> Bash script acts as a bridge between your local environment and Azure Storage. The core key components and functionalities that make it work are:</p>

          <section id="authentication">
              <h4>Authentication:</h4>
              <p>The script has a simple authentication process by installing the Azure CLI and authenticating users via device code authentication.</p>
              <p>(Displays login information and lets you know that you're logged in)</p>
          </section>

          <section id="region">
              <h4>Region Selection and Resource Group Handling:</h4>
              <p>Users are prompted to choose a region from a list of recommendations. The script then checks for the existence of a specified resource group and dynamically creates a new one if needed.</p>
          </section>

          <section id="storage">
              <h4>Storage Account and Container Handling:</h4>
              <p>Flexibility is a key feature of the script. It provides options to create new storage accounts and containers or use existing ones. Name uniqueness is ensured, enhancing user experience.</p>
          </section>

          <section id="file">
              <h4>File Handling:</h4>
              <p>The heart of the script lies in its ability to handle files. Users can upload a single file using the <code>-s</code> option or multiple files using the <code>-m</code> option. The script checks for existing files, offers options for overwriting, skipping, or renaming, and generates shareable links (SAS tokens) for the uploaded files.</p>
