Introduction
The following document's objective is to help provide a comprehensive plan to build a
dedicated local area network telecommunication room on the 10th floor and connect it back to
the data center on the second floor of the organization's building. Some objectives of this
document are to make a secure, dependable, redundant, and fast network. This is important for a
financial network as you are dealing with money and a compromise in the network or failure can
result in companywide economic loss.
This document will contain two solutions for ethernet switching equipment. The two
ethernet switching vendor solutions we will compare are Cisco and HP. Also provided in this
document is a diagram of the interconnection for the switching stacking solution. We have also
included our opinion on which solution is more advantageous for the company. This document
also addresses what rack and fiber patch panel we recommend for the network. Along with a
power plan to make sure power is supplied constantly guaranteeing a good uptime. All solutions
made meet the requirements set by the IT manager.
The requirements are at least 250 Gb Ethernet ports provided by fully managed,
stackable, rack mount Layer 2 switches to support edge connections. Fifty of these ports must
provide PoE. There must be at least 100 Gb Ethernet ports to support data center equipment.
These should be provided by managed, stackable, rack-mount Layer 3 switches. There must be
(2) 10Gb fiber ports in the switching equipment to allow this telecommunication room to connect
to the 10Gb fiber switches about one hundred yards away in the central data center on floor two.
A fiber patch panel and associated fiber patch cables must be provided – otherwise, the fiber
between floor two and floor ten is already present, terminated, and ready to plug into your fiber
4
patch panel. Three nineteen,” four post equipment racks will have to be provided. rackmountable UPS equipment that can provide power protection to all the ethernet switches, and
five 350-watt servers, and still have at least 40% capacity remaining. Specification must be
provided for the quantity and type of AC circuits and receptacles that electricians will be directed
to provide in the telecommunications room. If any one of the above items is a single point of
failure that could cause extended network outage time, spare parts or additional capacities should
be purchased and kept on site.

Fiber Term, Equip Racks & More
As far as what switching solution to use it makes sense to use Cisco. This is because the
rest of the network equipment in the company is Cisco, and we think it would be good to keep
the network equipment to one vendor instead of making a multi-vendor environment because
management and costs of a single security vendor strategy can minimize equipment management
and costs. Cisco also has more security options than HP.
The best Cisco solution is Edge switch solution option one and data center switch
solution option two. Which is five C9300L-48P-4G-E and three C9500-48Y4C. The reason
14
behind this is that this solution can achieve all the same features as the other options while
saving the most amount of money. All the switches also happen to support layer three
capabilities because layer two switches that meet all requirements of this are ruffly the same
price in most cases. Layer three capabilities are nice to have on the edge switches as if we decide
to implement VLANs it will allow for faster inter-VLAN routing.
This is our diagram for the switching solution and how we would stack the switches. We
built this diagram to provide maximum speed and redundancy. As there are multiple paths to
15
each switch all over fiber connections. We also used LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol)
in certain areas of the 10th floor to provide more reductant and bandwidth to the switches. Then
the links that will be used for connecting client devices will use the gigabit ethernet ports. We
also stacked all the edge switches together to make one logical switch and did the same for the
data center switches.
We should back up the running configuration of all the switches to a TFTP or FTP server
so that when we need to replace a switch, we can download the configuration from the server.
The actual stacking is a bit different for each floor. On the 10th floor, it will be using Stack wise
320 meaning the switches will have to be stacked in the order they are in the diagram and linked
up together by the stack cables that will go on the back of the switch like in the picture below.
The cables for reference are about three feet in length.
We also need a place to terminate the fiber cables. We recommend buying 2 FHU 1U 19''
Fiber Adapter Panel, 48 Fibers OM4 Multimode, 24 x LC UPC Duplex (Aqua) Adapter. This
supports multi-mode fiber which is meant for long distances like up to the 10th floor. You can
estimate it to be around one hundred feet. Multimode fiber can carry a signal up to 1804 feet. We
also suggest Beyond Tech LC to LC Fiber Patch Cable Multimode 3ft patch cables. They work
with the recommended patch panel and are cheap for fiber, sitting at around ten dollars per cable.
16
We suggest buying three Raising Electronics Server Rack 4 Post Open Rack Frame Rack
Enclosure 19 Inch 42U. We suggest this because it is a very efficient use of money as the cost of
one rack is only $ 220.30. It also meets all requirements having a nineteen” frame to fit all
equipment and giving lots of extra room left over to help be able to scale the network within
short notice.

Data Center Switches 4,500
Switches Total 10,000
Servers Total 1,750
Total 11,750
Total + 40% Capacity 16,450
The UPS we recommend to power all this equipment is seven V7 Uninterruptible Power
Supplies 3000VA UPS Rack Mount 2U LCD (UPS1RM2U3000-1N). We recommend this UPS
because it has more than enough power to power all the equipment with 45% capacity remaining.
It is also a rack-mountable device. It cost $5142.69. It also lasts for 20 mins once the power goes
out. To supply all the power to all these UPS’s we will need 7 AC three-phase connections that
supply 120 VAC.
18
In conclusion, we recommend getting five C9300L-48P-4G-E, three C9500-48Y4C plus
spare parts, two FHU 1U 19' Fiber Adapter Panels, 24 Beyond Tech LC to LC Fiber multimode
3ft patch cables, Three Raising Electronics Server Rack 4 Post Open Rack Frame Rack
Enclosure 19 Inch 42U, and seven V7 Uninterruptible Power Supplies 3000VA UPS Rack
Mount 2U LCD (UPS1RM2U3000-1N). The total cost for this will be excluding labor to install
equipment and the electrician to install AC connections is $76,557.59.
